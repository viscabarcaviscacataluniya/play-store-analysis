                                              The Android App Market on Google Play
Mobile apps are ubiquitous and increasingly easy to create, making them a lucrative opportunity for developers. As a result, the number of apps being developed is growing steadily.

In this DataCamp Guided Project, I conducted a detailed analysis of the Android app market by examining over ten thousand apps available on Google Play across various categories.

### Objectives:
- Uncover insights from the data to inform strategies for driving app growth and retention.

### Data Source:
The data for this project was sourced from the Google Play website. While datasets for the Apple App Store are more common, Google Play data is harder to scrape, which makes this dataset more valuable.

### Data Files:
- apps.csv: Contains detailed information about apps on Google Play, including various features describing each app.
- user_reviews.csv: Includes 100 reviews per app, sorted by relevance. Each review has been pre-processed and analyzed to assign a sentiment score.
